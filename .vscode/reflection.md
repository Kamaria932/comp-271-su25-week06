Reflection for Week 5's assignment:
I think I did a good job with the contains and resize method. I also think that the remove method was similar as well. The index of method had the same logic as prof. Leo. One thing that I could have done differently is the string to string method. I do not believe my output displays a message and I was not sure if its supposed to, but the method is completed and the code compiles. This week I found it harder to make sure the methods had one return statement and that all the tests successfully passed. I think this week I had to do a lot of debugging because of the multiple tests. It took a while to look for the error in my code and spot the incomplete line of code. I struggled the most with the counting method but overall I think I turned in a solid, clear, and simple code. I usually complete the assignment on Wednesday after reading, and drafting everything that has to be done, but this time I felt close to the deadline with evedrything I had to add to pass all of the six tasks.
